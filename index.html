        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>

        <p>I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. Not if I weaken first. Shields up! Rrrrred alert! The unexpected is our normal routine. We have a saboteur aboard. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. I'll alert the crew. Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. I am your worst nightmare!</p>

            <p>Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers?</p>

            <p>In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp.</p>

          <p>Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. This should be interesting. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. Talk about going nowhere fast. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Computer, belay that order. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data.</p>

              <p>We have a saboteur aboard. Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? Your shields were failing, sir. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me.</p>

              <p>You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! Ensign Babyface! Well, that's certainly good to know. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? I'll be sure to note that in my log. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others.</p>

        <p>The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." We have a saboteur aboard. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Not if I weaken first. Wouldn't that bring about chaos?</p>
